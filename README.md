Calculates Temporary Partial Disability payments under WC - for insurance adjusters



As an insurance adjuster, I calculate TPD payments on a weekly basis. This calculator takes some of the headache away, and saves repetitive typing. Prior to using this calculator, one would have to do the calculations and then type a message out explaining the calculations... essentially doing it twice.
All you have to do is put in the starting amount, date range, and earnings during the period. 
This calculator does the math for you, and even prints a note you can copy/paste into your claim file.
